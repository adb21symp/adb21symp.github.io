Ana Nunez,Combes Lab,1st,talk,Stem Cell Model for Human Kidney Fibrosis,"With ~700 million individuals affected by chronic kidney disease (CKD) globally and no antifibrotic treatment currently approved for CKD patients, there is an urgent need to develop better models of human fibrotic kidneys to accelerate the discovery of novel therapies. In this regard, organoids have a proven ability to replicate aspects of genetic kidney disease and are amenable to high throughput screening. However,  complex processes such as fibrosis or CKD have not been comprehensively modelled with this in vitro approach. Here, we aim to generate the first human-derived in vitro 3D model of renal fibrosis, a common hallmark in CKD and end-stage renal disease patients, that would represent a significant advance for drug development and testing in this field. It will involve cutting edge organoid culture, imaging, and single cell transcriptional profiling."
Georgia Cuffe,Risbridger/Taylor Lab,1st,talk,Bipolar Androgen Therapy induces heterogenous changes in the abundance and localisation of the androgen receptor in advanced prostate cancer,"Background: Androgen deprivation therapy is the primary treatment for advanced prostate cancer. Despite sustained suppression of androgens, patients eventually develop castration-resistant prostate cancer and require further treatment. A new treatment is Bipolar Androgen Therapy (BAT), where patients rapidly cycle between castrate and supraphysiological testosterone levels to prevent tumours adapting to therapy. Clinical trials of BAT are promising, but patient responses vary.

Hypothesis & Aims: We hypothesised that changes in the expression of the androgen receptor (AR) and truncated AR-variants (ARVs) were associated with response to BAT. To test this, we profiled AR and ARVs in patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) of prostate cancer before and after treatment with BAT.

Methods: We treated five, phenotypically diverse PDXs (1x BAT-sensitive, 4x BAT-resistant) with vehicle or BAT (fortnightly, intramuscular injections, 1mg testosterone cypionate). Tumours were harvested at 24-hours, 5 days, and endpoint (7-weeks or 1000mm3). Expression of full-length AR (AR-FL), ARVs, and AR target-genes were measured using quantitative PCR. AR abundance and localisation were quantified using immunohistochemistry against different forms of the AR. 

Results: Untreated PDXs had heterogeneous patterns of AR-FL and ARV expression. Acute BAT treatment downregulated the expression of AR mRNA, except in tumours with structural rearrangements of the AR gene (i.e. 27.1, 27.2). BAT also decreased nuclear AR protein levels in a BAT-sensitive PDX (i.e. 201.1), but not in BAT-resistant PDXs. Changes in AR-FL persisted at 5 days and endpoint, despite fluctuations in testosterone over a cycle of BAT. Expression of ARV mRNA mirrored differences in protein levels. Expression of PSMA, an AR target-gene, was suppressed over time regardless of BAT response. 

Conclusions: In patient-derived models, reduced nuclear AR protein expression following BAT may define a subset of tumours sensitive to BAT alone. Combination therapies may be an alternative for tumours that are resistant to BAT, and are currently in clinical trials.

Georgina Stephens,Lazarus Lab,1st,talk,Exploring Uncertainty Tolerance in Monash University Medical Students,"Introduction: There is growing attention on uncertainty tolerance (UT) as a medical training competency, including assessment with UT scales. Yet little is known about how medical students experience uncertainty, nor factors that impact UT development. Accordingly, this research asked: ‘How do medical students experience and manage (i.e. tolerate) uncertainty?’, aiming to explore UT in preclinical and clinical students, and to evaluate the reliability and validity of UT scales in this population. 

Methods: Medical student experiences of uncertainty were explored through longitudinal qualitative research, using online forums, semi-structured interviews and reflective diaries. Evidence for UT scale reliability and validity was evaluated through systematic review and meta-analysis, including meta-analysis of Cronbach’s alphas, and assessment of multiple forms of validity evidence. 

Results: Students described a range of uncertainties: some related to learning medicine, others extended to professional and personal uncertainties. Multiple factors appeared to impact students’ UT, and were predominantly socially determined. Although responses to uncertainty described were predominantly negative (e.g. worry), reflections on uncertainty were predominantly positive (e.g. identifying learning opportunities). Meta-analysis of UT scale reliability identified significantly lower reliability among medical students than doctors. Validity evidence for UT scales was critically lacking for response processes.

Conclusion: This research highlights avenues for educational intervention that could develop students’ UT, including student- (e.g. reflective learning) and educator- (e.g. role modelling UT) led interventions. Currently, there is inadequate evidence for UT scale psychometrics among medical student populations, thus implementing these scales in high-stakes applications is cautioned. Future research exploring reasons underpinning identified population differences in UT scale reliability is warranted. "
María Hernaiz García,Fiorenza Lab,1st,talk,Biomechanics of the Neanderthal anterior dentition,"The aim of my PhD project is to examine the masticatory system of Neanderthals from a functional and biomechanical point of view. By carrying out 3D modelling of bones and teeth from a wide Neanderthal and modern human fossil sample and by virtually reconstruct the simulation of their chewing behaviour, I will be able to assess if Neanderthal cranio-dental morphology was truly adapted to resist powerful bite forces."
Mehran,Combes Lab,1st,talk,Using single cell and spatial transcriptomics to investigate kidney development and disease,"Realizing the full potential of single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in biomedical science
has been hindered by the high cost of experiments, a lack of spatial context, and limited
capacity to analyze the resulting data. This project will focus on developing robust methods
and analysis pipelines to address these challenges in the context of kidney development and
disease. Cost reductions will be sought by establishing pipelines to demultiplex pooled
scRNA-seq samples. Optimized pooled sequencing methods will be used to generate
comprehensive profiles of diseased human kidney tissue in partnership with Monash
Medical Centre. Integrated analysis of scRNA-seq and novel spatial transcriptomic
approaches will be used to assess signaling interactions within intact cellular communities.
One focus will be the mechanisms of cell type specification during kidney development.
Understanding how renal cell types form will guide the production of cell types currently
missing from stem cell models of the human kidney. A second focus will be the molecular
mechanisms underlying human kidney disease in adulthood."
Qi Fan,Pocock Lab,1st,talk,Deciphering transcriptional control of germ cell development,"The Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) germline is an efficient reproduction system driven by a GLP-1/Notch regulatory network to control germ cell proliferation and differentiation. It shares multiple features with germlines of other animals, such as the existence of a self-renewing germline stem cell population. By examining the C. elegans germline in vivo, we can investigate various germline functions such as germ cell maturation, cell signalling and apoptosis. The regulatory network controlling germline development requires precise transcriptional regulation. The C. elegans genome encodes 875 transcription factors. Based on germline-specific RNA-sequencing data from our lab, 368 of these transcription factors are expressed in the germline. However, the majority of these transcription factors are understudied. Through germline-specific transcription factor RNAi knockdown and phenotypic analysis of the germ cell behaviour, we will identify transcription factors that regulate germ line development and function. By further functional analysis of the of these transcription factors, we will gain understanding of transcriptional regulation in germline stem cell maintenance, cell fate specification, cell signalling and apoptosis."
Rajan Venkatraman,Kile/De Nardo lab,1st,talk,Molecular mechanisms of STING responses,"Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) play a vital role in the detection of pathogens and danger signals within the innate immune system. Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) acts as PRR that detects cytosolic dsDNA, a common hallmark of infection. Additionally, cGAS can also recognise host dsDNA that leaks from the mitochondria or nuclei. Detection of dsDNA by cGAS induces the production of the novel cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) 2’3’-cGAMP. 2’3’-cGAMP binds and activates the endoplasmic reticulum resident protein Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING).  Following activation, STING induces a potent type I interferon (type I IFN) response which stimulates transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). ISGs encode antiviral proteins that facilitates elimination of infected cells. Moreover, the cGAS-STING pathway also activates other non-IFN cellular responses via the transcription factor NF-κB and MAPKs to induce production of proinflammatory cytokines. Recent studies have established the importance of non-IFN STING responses in the context of immunity and disease. From murine models, the pathogenesis of the STING-mediated autoinflammatory disease, appears strongly dependent upon non-IFN response, such as NF-κB activation, rather than IRF3 activation. Similarly, non-IFN STING responses have been found to be critical for protection against HSV-1 viral infection and anti-tumour immunity. This illustrates the importance of studying the mechanism that mediate STINGs non-IFN responses , which can provide the groundwork for new therapeutics development.

Upon activation STING recruits the downstream kinase TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) to induce the production of type I IFNs. Recently, TBK1 and its homologue IκB kinase epsilon (IKKε) have recently been shown to induce the canonical activation of NF-κB in response to STING activation. However, the mechanisms through which TBK1 and IKKε are activated and how they mediate STING responses remain poorly understood. My PhD project will focus on characterising the molecular mechanisms involved in the recruitment and activation of TBK1 and IKKε, and how they regulate downstream non-IFN STING responses."
Rand Zaza,Heng Lab,1st,talk,Combining immune modification and tissue engineering approaches for more effective stem cell-based therapy,"Mesenchymal stromal cells, also referred to as (mesenchymal stem cells; MSCs), are ideal candidates for regenerative medicine and cellular therapeutics due to several qualities they possess. Nowadays, MSCs are the subject of extensive research to explore their best applicable potential, and pinpoint the keys these cells hold that can open doors in the area of regenerative medicine and inflammatory disease amelioration. Cellular therapy approaches utilizing MSCs face the hindrances of MSC- heterogeneity, immunogenicity due to donor variability, their different routes of delivery and migratory capacity, and the mechanisms governing their immunomodulatory properties. 
This research project aims at addressing the regenerative and tissue repair potential of locally administered MSCs by implementing a new technology to generate a homogeneous, safe, and “under control” MSCs from PSCs for therapeutic applications that require differentiated MSCs to persist at the site of injury. 
On the other hand, this research project simultaneously addresses the apoptotic MSCs metabolite release that confers therapeutic efficacy of intravenously administered MSCs despite their quick clearance after administration. Building on previous findings we aim to identify metabolites released by apoptotic MSCs that are of relevance to their therapeutic outcomes, investigate how genetic deletion of PANX-1 channel in MSCs would affect their therapeutic effects in a lung disease model (PANX1 deletion will block the metabolites released from that channel during MSC apoptosis), and in relevance we aim to investigate how the therapeutic efficacy of MSC-apoptotic bodies compare to that of intravenously administered MSCs.

Harmanjeet Singh,Harvey Lab,1st,talk,Exploring the Hippo Signalling Pathway through high resolution Electron Microscopy,"Over recent years, the Hippo signalling pathway has emerged as a regulator of key developmental processes, including organ size and tissue growth. Initially identified in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, this evolutionarily conserved signalling pathway comprises of over 35 components, each fitting into a complex network feeding a central kinase cascade. Deregulation in Hippo signalling has been observed in several types of human cancers; therefore, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms by which the Hippo pathway components regulate tissue growth. 

Confocal microscopy approaches have been used to visualise protein dynamics, localisation, and abundance, and have provided important insights into Hippo signalling, however, these are limited by their resolution of 200nm. This often makes it difficult to definitively assess protein localisation at specific subcellular domains. Electron microscopy (EM), alternatively, provides high resolution (up to 0.2nm), ultra-structural details and has the potential to generate new insights into the subcellular localisation of Hippo pathway proteins and hence Hippo signal transduction. A recently developed EM technique which fuses an ascorbate peroxidase (APEX2) with a GFP binding peptide (GBP) can work with a growing library of GFP-bound proteins and allows for a versatile reporter tool to visualise GFP-bound protein localisation in EM.

Monika Mohenska,Polo Lab,1st,talk,Unraveling the epigenetic landscape of the reprogramming roadmap at single cell resolution,"Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which are derived through the process of reprogramming from human somatic cells, have the potential to differentiate into any cell type of the body. iPSCs can be cultured in a naive state that resembles the preimplantation epiblast, or a primed state that resembles the post-implantation epiblast. In a recent study from our laboratory, naive and primed iPSCs were derived by reprogramming of human dermal fibroblasts through the use of different media. However, the underlying epigenetic mechanisms behind these conversions remain largely unknown. In this study, we have profiled the reprogramming epigenetic dynamics of these cells at high resolution using single cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing. Our data identified various differential chromatin accessible regions across all of the cell states during reprogramming of fibroblasts into naive and primed iPSCs, as well as the cells refractory to the reprogramming process. Furthermore, we have jointly assessed the epigenetic landscape and gene expression of the reprogramming trajectory at single cell resolution revealing epigenetic specific information in cell fate commitment. Our extensive characterisation provides novel insight into the reprogramming roadmap of somatic cells into iPSCs."
Lauren Alesi,Hutt Lab,2nd,talk,Checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy diminishes oocyte number and quality: consequences for fertility of female cancer survivors,"Conventional cytotoxic cancer therapies exert permanent damage to the ovary; hence, loss of fertility is a major concern for female reproductive-age cancer survivors. However, the landscape of cancer therapies is rapidly changing, with attention shifting to more personalised, targeted treatments. Immunotherapies, like checkpoint inhibitors anti-PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4, harness the immune system to kill tumour cells. They are increasingly becoming a standard of care for many tumour types, including in the curative setting. But, their impacts on ovarian function and fertility are unknown. 

We evaluated the effect of anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies on the ovary using tumour-bearing and tumour-free mouse models. In tumour bearing mice, combination immune checkpoint inhibition (anti-PD-1 + anti-CTLA-4) increased recruitment of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to the ovary, and increased local TNF-α cytokine production. Disruptions to ovarian function were observed, with increased death (atresia) of pre-ovulatory ovarian follicles and fewer corpora lutea present (indicating reduced ovulations).

Profound and permanent impacts to ovarian function were also detected in tumour-free mice. PD-L1 or CTLA-4 blockade induced significant depletion of the non-renewable supply of primordial follicles (containing immature oocytes). Notably, in women, primordial follicle depletion is associated with early loss of fertility and premature menopause. Furthermore, the number of healthy, mature ovulated oocytes was significantly reduced following anti-CTLA-4 treatment, whereas anti-PD-L1 increased the number of fragmented/dead oocytes. 

Collectively, these data demonstrate that immune checkpoint inhibitors have the potential to impair both the immediate and future fertility of young women. Hence, fertility preservation should be strongly considered for women receiving these immunotherapies, and investigation of preventative strategies must be prioritised in future studies. "
Rebecca Cornell,Pocock Lab,2nd,talk,Neuronal Control of Mitochondrial Stress Responses and their Impact on Metabolism,"
Mitochondrial stress responses are essential molecular mechanisms that maintain homeostasis when an organism is faced with stress. Local stress responses can be communicated to distal tissues to enable global reactions to challenges, thereby increasing the chance of organismal survival. The nervous system is critical for coordinating systemic stress responses, yet the mechanisms by which this is achieved remain largely unknown. Using the model Caenorhabditis elegans, we aim to generate a more holistic understanding of how the nervous system controls distal mitochondrial function and health.

We previously showed that the E-twenty-six transcription factor ETS-5 controls intestinal fat storage from pair of head sensory neurons (the BAG neurons). Increased intestinal fat storage in the absence of ETS-5 induces a sleep-like state known as quiescence. As sleep and metabolic alterations are a hallmark of systemic stress responses, the combination of increased fat storage and quiescence in an ets-5 mutant implicates ETS-5 as a potential stress mediator. Our subsequent analysis revealed that ETS-5 indeed controls a highly specific systemic mitochondrial stress response. Furthermore, we found that the BAG neurons utilise several neuropeptide networks – both dependent and independent of ETS-5 – to illicit unique systemic mitochondrial stress responses. These responses have differing effects on organismal health and mitochondrial function, the full effects of which are being deciphered.

Shemona Rozario,Lazarus Lab,2nd,talk,Exploring professional identity formation in junior doctors and registrars: A focus on anatomical pathology.,"Anatomical pathology is a critical specialty in the tissue diagnosis of diseases, such as cancers.  A current and anticipated anatomical pathology workforce shortage is predicted to delay diagnoses and the commencement of urgent treatment required for patients.  A cause of this workforce shortage has been a deficiency in professional identity development, from a lack of exposure, to anatomical pathology during the medical student and junior doctor years.  This research aims to explore, in depth, current perceptions and professional identity development in junior doctors interested in pursuing anatomical pathology training, and anatomical pathology registrars.  It is hoped these findings will help target areas of improvement to aid recruitment and training of future anatomical pathologists."
Tejasvini Bhuvan,Heng Lab,2nd,talk,The spleen is indispensable for the immunosuppressive activity of mesenchymal stromal cells in OVA allergic asthma,"In the past decade, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have developed a substantial portfolio in clinical trials, becoming the focus of many regenerative immunotherapies. Besides being multipotent and having self-renewal capacity, MSCs possess anti-inflammatory properties. However, the mechanisms underlying their immunosuppressive effects remain poorly understood. We showed that upon intravenous (i.v.) administration, MSCs localise to the lungs and undergo caspase 3-dependent apoptosis within 1 hour. Furthermore, efferocytosis of apoptotic MSCs modulated the effector functions of lung phagocytes, especially alveolar macrophages. Secondary lymphoid organs, such as the spleen, are responsible for trapping foreign antigens entering via bloodstream. Therefore, we expected to see the spleen as central to the establishment of anti-inflammatory effects seen in MSC therapy. In an OVA-induced allergic asthma model, the immunosuppressive effects of MSC administration were abrogated in splenectomised mice. MSCs failed to inhibit lung eosinophilia and OVA-specific T cell restimulation responsiveness, including IL-5 and IL-13 production, in splenectomised mice. Splenectomised mice treated with MSCs had comparable levels of mucous production to their untreated counterparts, evident through lung histology. Overall, the spleen is indispensable for the immunosuppressive effects of i.v.-injected MSCs in OVA allergic asthma. "
Joanne Coyle,Arumugam Lab,2nd,talk,The Use of Min Waves to Understand Intrinsically Disordered Regions Involved in phase Separation,"Liquid liquid phase separation (LLPS) is a biological phenomenon whereby proteins separate out from the liquid cytoplasm into a phase separated compartment or “droplet”. These droplets are highly concentrated in protein and represent a dynamic environment in which proteins can easily flow in and out of. However, what causes a protein to phase separate? One of the comparable characteristics amongst proteins that undergo LLPS is that they contain stretches of amino acids that are intrinsically disordered. These intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) take part in specific protein-protein interactions that drive proteins to phase separate. This project aims to further understand these interactions through the use of a reaction-diffusion system called Min waves. Min waves are formed through the attachment and detachment of two proteins on the bacteria cell membrane – MinD and MinE. These proteins produce visible wave patterns which can be reproduced on artificial lipid bilayers. By attaching IDRs relevant for phase separation onto MinD, the resulting IDR interactions can be studied by assessing the resulting wave patterns. Stronger and weaker IDR interactions result in different wave patterns. These waves can be mathematically modelled using coding software, giving an insight to the interactions in IDRs.

Genetic information flows from DNA to RNA (transcription) and RNA to protein (translation) – referred to as the ‘central dogma’ of molecular biology. ‘Epigenetic’ modification takes place on DNA and histones without changing the DNA sequences to control transcriptional output (DNA to RNA). While ‘epitranscriptomic/ RNA epigenetic’ modification happens in RNAs (at the post-transcriptional level) without altering the RNA sequences to control RNA turnover and translation. Hence, RNA modifications add a new paradigm to the central dogma. To date, more than 150 RNA modifications have been identified in different classes of RNAs in various organisms; only a few of them are commonly occurring and emerging fields of study in gene regulation. Although epigenetic and epitranscriptomic modifications act at different layers of gene regulation programs, recently, a handful of studies revealed the ‘crosstalk’ between these two pathways in controlling gene expression. However, the underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood and remain a critical area of research interest in the gene regulation field.
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA methylation is the most abundant, and reversible internal RNA modification discovered in eukaryotic mRNAs, and non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play crucial roles in splicing, export, decay/stability and translation that ultimately control various biological processes. The deposition of m6A is catalyzed by the m6A-methyltransferases – METTL3, METTL14 (m6A-writers). Conversely, m6A deposition can be removed by m6A-demethylases – FTO and ALKBH (m6A-erasers). In addition, a group of m6A-binding proteins (m6A-readers) – such as  YTHDF1-3, YTHDC1-2, IGF2BP1-3 and HNRNPs — have been identified that recognise m6A in mRNAs and govern the fate of their targeted mRNAs. Nevertheless, current knowledge regarding the molecular and biological function of m6A-readers is incomplete and controversial. Hence, we have expanded the search to identify new m6A-readers in murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs), which identified UPF1 as a novel m6A-reader. My research focuses on investigating the molecular functions of UPF1 and its roles in maintaining the mESCs state. In addition, I found a physical interaction between LSD1/KDM1A (histone demethylase that removes H3K4me1,2 marks from histone tail) and YTHDF2 (m6A-reader) in mESCs. This emerged as a new avenue to study the crosstalk between epigenetic and epitranscriptomic pathways and their functions in gene regulation for the ESC maintenance that is currently underway. Altogether, these studies will delineate – the tasks of new m6A-reader protein in the m6A pathway; also establish further mechanistic details in connecting epigenetic and epitranscriptomic pathways for gene regulation – to maintain the ESC state, impacting regenerative biology.

Harrison York,Arumugam Lab,2nd ,talk,Deterministic Early Endosomal Maturation Driven By EEA1 Noise Suppression,"Endosomal trafficking in single cells is built of generation of membrane vesicles, their motor protein mediated transport, morphological alterations such as tubulation, fusion and fission, and dynamic maintenance of various identities, which is defined by the lipid composition and localization of specific proteins on them. Endosomal maturation is a major process in endosomal trafficking in which endosomes shed one specific protein and acquire another, resulting in an identity change. Individual processes that build up endosomal trafficking, including conversions, are interlinked and are inherently stochastic. While the general biochemical interactions have been well described, how all the events come together to overcome the inherent noise and stochasticity is much less explored. Here, capitalising on the rapid volumetric imaging capability of Lattice-light sheet, we capture whole-cell volumes, enabling post-acquisition analysis of all conversion events as well as other dynamic characteristics. We show that early endosome maturation is driven by endosomal collision-induced conversions. Furthermore, using live-cell Förster Resonance Energy Transfer, we demonstrate that this is underpinned by cyclical conformational changes in EEA1, which promotes the biochemical maturation of these vesicles through its asymmetric binding capacity and clustering on the endosomal membranes. Using simulations, we recapture the experimentally observed characteristics in the reaction scheme and the activity of EEA1. Based on these experiments, we describe an EEA1-dependent mechanism that enables deterministic outcomes in ensemble endosomal conversions in an otherwise stochastic system."
Di Zheng,Heng Lab,3rd,talk,Extravascular MSC treatment induces immunoregulatory innate immune cells to dampen inflammation,"Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have anti-inflammatory and tissue-reparative potentials. As such, MSCs present as a therapeutic cell type in inflammatory diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying their immunoregulatory effects are not well understood. MSC secretomes are thought to mediate their therapeutic effects. Recent studies from our lab and others highlighted MSC apoptosis in the lung following intravenous infusion, as a critical step in MSC-induced immunoregulation. MSCs administered via extravascular routes do not undergo apoptosis in the lung but have also been shown to exert therapeutic benefits. To investigate the mechanisms in extravascular administration of MSCs, we have established a mouse model of localised inflammation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and injected MSCs either directly at the site of inflammation (ipsilateral) or at the contralateral side. MSC treatment dampened inflammation by inducing an increase in IL-10-expressing immunoregulatory innate immune cells in the draining lymph nodes. Injected MSCs were detected only at the site of injection, yet induced an increase in immunosuppressive molecules, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, in splenic myeloid population. This suggests the potential role of splenic immunoregulation in extravascular MSC treatment. Our data indicate that innate immune cells in the secondary lymphoid organs are important mediators of the anti-inflammatory effects of MSC treatment."
Diji Kuriakose,Xiao Lab,3rd,talk,REGULATION OF UPSTREAM FACTORS OF miR-9/29a/107 IN NEUROGENESIS,"miR-9/29a/107 are key players in neurodegeneration. Hence, we foresee that identifying the upstream regulators of our miRNA biogenesis through QTL mapping in cc mice will reveal the genetic architecture behind this phenomenon. Further, functional studies from Neural Progenitor cells isolated from the hippocampus will identify roles in neurogenesis. This will unveil novel regulatory proteins that target miR-9/29a/107. The in vivo experiments in mice will further unveil the interaction between regulatory protein and miR-9/29a/107 in neurogenesis. The pathways associated with these factors will potentially open new therapeutic interventions to deal with age related cognitive decline and neurodegeneration."
Jasveena Kaur,Abud Lab,3rd,talk,The Role of the Enteric Nervous System in Regulating the Function of the Gastrointestinal Epithelium,"Normal functioning of the gastrointestinal tract involves the communication between multiple essential cell types located in close proximity, such as epithelial cells and the enteric nervous system (ENS). Studies have shown that intestinal epithelial stem cells express neurotransmitter receptors that may directly modulate stem cell fate and epithelial cell renewal upon activation. To test this, we aim to investigate the role of some of these candidate neurotransmitters in regulating the proliferation, differentiation and permeability of the epithelium using organoids as a model system. This may allow us to assess the contribution of the ENS in the progression of gastrointestinal diseases, which could be beneficial in providing targeted therapies for patients."
Kate Balka ,Kile/De Nardo Lab ,3rd,talk,Investigating the mechanisms of Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) subcellular localisation ,"Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) is a critical component of the innate immune response against microbial infection. Activation of STING is induced following the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) present within the host cell cytosol during infection. Following activation, STING signalling promotes the expression of type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines to induce an immune response. In the steady state, STING is located on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Following activation, STING traffics to the Golgi, which is important for recruitment of key kinases (e.g. TBK1) for downstream signalling events. To prevent sustained inflammation, STING signalling is ultimately terminated within endolysosomal compartments. However, many questions still remain regarding the timing and mechanisms of STING relocalisation from the ER, and how this controls inflammatory STING responses. To understand the kinetics of STING signalling in macrophages I am utilising fluorescent live-cell microscopy approaches to characterise the dynamics of STING translocation across organelles and association with key known interactors. Additionally I have performed a global phosphoproteomic screen in primary murine macrophages following STING activation over time. Gene ontology (GO) analysis of proteins undergoing phosphorylation changes has shown time-dependent signatures. This screening approach also identified several novel proteins and phosphorylation events, not previously associated with the STING pathway. I am now using CRISPR/Cas9 editing to investigate the role of these proteins in regulating the STING response using both biochemical approaches and imaging tools I have generated. Aberrant cGAS-STING activation and/or disruption of STING localisation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. Therefore, understanding STING trafficking is important for effective therapeutic targeting of STING-associated inflammatory disease.

Ullhas Kaarthi Moorthi,Arumugam Lab,3rd,talk,Role of EEA1 in Recycling Endosome biogenesis and Cargo sorting,"The Endosomal-network begins at the plasma membrane following endocytosis by undergoing successive fusion resulting in maturation. The Rab effector proteins APPL1 and EEA1 drive endosomes towards the peri-nuclear cloud. The first part of the Ph.D. thesis establishes the role of APPL1 and dynein specific to endosome maturation. The second part addresses how multivalent EEA1 provides a physical basis for endosomal fusion and identifies its role in colocalization with Rab22a, which mediates Recycling-endosome biogenesis. A combination of live-cell imaging and super-resolution microscopy will be utilized to tease-apart dynamic details and molecular distributions of tightly regulated vectoral endosomal maturation."
Zexiong Su,Liu Lab,3rd,talk,Mitochondrial calcium governed by cytoplasmic NAD+ regulates energy production,"The ability of cells to sense energy status and coordinate mitochondrial metabolism for energy homeostasis is critical for organismal development and survival. Mitochondrial calcium signaling has emerged as a key mediator of mitochondrial bioenergetics. Currently there is a significant knowledge gap regarding how mitochondrial calcium is adjusted to cellular energetics. Here, we report mitochondrial calcium in C. elegans muscle cells progressively decline during development and is modulated by cytosolic NAD+. We find that increasing cytoplasmic NAD+ level reduces mitochondrial calcium by promoting mitochondrial matrix calcium efflux. Examining mitochondrial calcium dynamics throughout development reveals a link between mitochondrial calcium handling and mitochondrial content. Intriguingly, decreased mitochondrial calcium with loss of mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU-1) also increases mitochondrial content and thus augments ATP production. Collectively, our data uncover a previously unidentified non-oxidative role of NAD+ in regulating mitochondrial calcium handling and reveal a novel mechanism of mitochondrial metabolic adaptation to cellular energy demands."
Abhishek Patil,Arumugam Lab,3rd,talk,Removing bottlenecks between image acquisition to analysis,"Lattice light-sheet microscopy, a rapid volumetric imaging technique, acquires images using a plane of excitation which results in images being acquired at an oblique angle. For a typical acquisition of two colour movies of endosomal trafficking at 4 volumes per second for 20 min, about 20 TB of data is generated. Visualisation of the data to adjudge the quality and proceed to analysis is the first bottleneck. This involves deskewing of the data and rapid visualisation. Visualization will be performed on a custom visualiser or using virtual reality (VR) The second bottleneck is image segmentation. While routines like water-shed segmentation can perform reasonably well, they are slow and computationally intensive. To speed this process up, machine learning based approaches will be employed. However, for this, training data sets that accurately capture the signal containing voxels. Post segmentation, curating the data is a cumbersome process. I plan to utilize VR with direct gesture controlled functions to swiftly generate training data set based on semi-manual approaches. Lastly, complete visualisation of all steps, including further analysis such as tracking and motility analysis will also be integrated in VR."
Rasoul Godini,Pocock Lab,3rd,talk,Dissecting the role of the Doublesex DMD-9 transcription factor in C. elegans,"Almost all multicellular organisms have two sexes that exhbit dimorphic molecular and morphological characteristics. Development, including sexually dimorphic development is regulated by transcription factors. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, sexually dimorphic characteristics are regulated by transcription factors from Doublesex DNA Domain family. DMD-9 is a member of this family that shows a restricted expression pattern to a few unidentified sensory neurons. DMD-9 function is unknown. Here, I investigated the endogenous dmd-9 expression in both sexes of C. elegans, hermaphrodite and male, to identify potential sexually dimorphic expression patterns. TO enable this analysis, I used CRISPR-Cas9 to generate an in frame GFP knock-in at the last exon of dmd-9. Additionally, I performed RNA sequencing to identify alterations in the transcriptome in dmd-9 mutant animals. My results show that dmd-9 is expressed in several bilaterally-symmetric left/right pairs of sensory neurons in the head, including BAGL/R, AWBL/R, AWCL/R, and ASEL/R. In addition, I found that as animals become sexually mature, dmd-9 expression is lost in one of the AWCs. In addition, I identified 571 deregulated genes in dmd-9 mutants. My future research aims to dissect the precise functions for DMD-9 in the C. elegans nervous system."
Xinran Cheng,Liu Lab,3rd,talk,TIG-2 Modulates Age-Related Mobility Loss and Lifespan in C. elegans,"Aging, as a time-dependent physiological functional decline, is driven by multiple factors, and is accompanied by an increased risk of many chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, cancer, and some neurodegeneration diseases. Among all age-related functional decline, locomotion impairment is one of the most prominent outcomes. Although slower movement with age could result from multi types of impairment in different tissues, previous research highlights the age-dependent changes at neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) play a key role in mobility loss. Given its short lifespan and tractable genetic tools, nematode C. elegans offers an ideal model for aging study, especially at genetic and cellular levels. Previous study has demonstrated that age-related decline in neurotransmission at NMJs directly induces slow locomotion in older C. elegans. However, the underlying biological principals of age-related functional deterioration at NMJs is still unclear. Here, we show that a genetic mutation in tig-2, a retrograde BMP signaling of TGF-β family not only slows age-related mobility loss, but also extends lifespan in C. elegans. Surprisingly, tig-2 mutant exhibit comparable presynaptic components and physiological function of body wall muscle cells as wild type worms, suggesting an unknown physiological function of TIG-2 in C. elegans. We also found the functional decay in NMJs by exposing worms to aldicarb and electrophysiology recording. In addition, the copy of mitochondria DNA is reduced in tig-2 mutant, which indicated the decreased number of mitochondria. The lower ATP level of tig-2 mutant compared with that of wide type worms is also consist with the mobility loss in the early life of C. elegans. "

Epitranscriptomic or RNA epigenetic modifications take place at the post-transcriptional level in transcribed RNAs without altering any RNA sequences. Over 150 different types of RNA modifications have been identified in diverse classes of RNA in various organisms. However, recent advancement in high throughput sequencing technology has been able to map a few of these modifications, including 5-methylcytosine (m5C) transcriptome-wide, enabling the understanding of the molecular and biological functions of these RNA modifications. The m5C RNA methylation is catalysed by m5C-writers/methyltransferases (TRDMT1 and NSUN1-7) in various types of RNA, mostly in tRNA, rRNA and mitochondrial RNA, and a small number of mRNA. Putative m5C-erasers/demethylases (TETs) reverses this modification, while ALYREF is the only m5C-reader discovered so far that recognises m5C. To date, no studies have reported the roles of m5C in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Thus, in my PhD study, I focus on investigating the roles of NSUN2 (the best-studied m5C methyltransferase) in murine ESCs (mESCs). To analyse the functions of NSUN2-mediated m5C RNA methylation in mESCs, we generated Nsun2 KO mESCs, which displayed a self-renewal defect. Subsequent molecular analyses determined NSUN2 mediates m5C RNA methylation predominantly in tRNA and mRNA, including several critical mESC-specific transcripts. Moreover, we demonstrated that NSUN2 regulates the deposition of m5C in mRNAs co-transcriptionally. The current investigation is underway to examine whether and how m5C RNA methylation controls tRNA and mRNA fates to define the self-renewal defects in Nsun2 KO. I anticipate this study will dissect the detailed molecular functions of NSUN2-mediated m5C RNA methylation in gene regulatory functions that are critical for maintaining the mESC state for the first time.

XUEBI CAI,Carroll Lab,3rd,talk,TOP3A is required for the maintenance of the ovarian follicular reserve and oocyte quality,"Purpose: 
Several lines of evidence from non-vertebrate organisms suggest TOP3A is critical for quality control in oocytes, with roles in the repair of meiotic DNA double strand breaks and DNA damage, and in the maintenance of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Whilst compelling, the role of TOP3A in the gametes of mammalian species has never been established. Hence, this study aims to use novel mouse models to define the importance of TOP3A in the female gametes.

Methods:
Follicle Enumeration and in vitro fertilisation was conducted to determine the number and quality of TOP3A deficient oocytes. Microinjection of GFP-tagged TOP3A, in vitro oocyte maturation, and measurement of mtDNA copy number were performed to investigate the role of TOP3A in mitochondrial function.
	
Results:
Loss of Top3A leads to a dramatic loss of follicles in adult mice. Though the ovarian reserve is not compromised in young TOP3A oocyte-cKO mice, almost all the oocytes fail to be fertilized in vitro. Moreover, GFP-tagged TOP3A and mitochondria co-localized during the whole process of oocyte maturation, and mtDNA copy number in KO oocytes is significantly lower than that in WT oocytes.

Conclusions:
Top3A is required for healthy oocyte development and fertilization. Additionally, TOP3A is important for maintenance of mitochondrial function."
Michael Larcombe,Polo Lab,3rd,talk,Dissecting the Regulatory Complexes Controlling  Expression of the Pluripotency Factors,"Cellular identity is ultimately dictated by the interaction of transcription factors with regulatory elements (REs) to control gene expression. Genome-wide epigenome profiling techniques have significantly increased our understanding of cell-specific utilization of REs. However, it remains difficult to dissect the majority of factors interacting with these REs due to the lack of appropriate techniques. We developed TINC: TALE-mediated isolation of nuclear chromatin to dissect the factors responsible for cell-specific utilization of a RE. Using TINC we interrogated the protein complex formed at the Nanog promoter in embryonic stem cells, identifying known and novel complex members. To address the major limitations of single-locus proteomics technologies such as TINC, I’m currently optimizing tandem immunoprecipitation strategies to reduce non-specific enrichment of proteins.
